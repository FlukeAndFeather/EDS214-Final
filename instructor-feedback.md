# Exceeds Spec
## Automate Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document
I believe my quarto doc is concise, organized and is a clear model of my project that hides all the background complexity. My belief is probably wrong, I would really like to know how I can make it of professional quality because at the end of the day in the workforce what matters most is what you show your boss. 

## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file
I re factored the Environment Initialization (init_envi.R) and the function rolling_mean.R into their own files which makes running my analysis very clean. I used a roxygen for the function and both files explain what is happening in the footnotes. 

# Collaboration
My participation in peer feedback went very well. I chose to give extra attention to a few things because at the stage my partner was at, it was most helpful for me to help start organizing his folders so that once he got there, he had a good foundation to build off. I also give my reviewer ideas about what I needed help with and made it easy for her to give me feedback by checking in about where I was at in my process.
